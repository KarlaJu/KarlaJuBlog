##### ~Extract from the book of david Thomas and Andrew Hunt

> Programming is about trying to make the future less painful. It's about making things easier for our teammates. It's about getting things wrong and being able to bounce back. It's about forming good habits. It's about understanding your toolset. Coding is just part of th worl of being a programmer.

>There is a unique dedication to learning and practicality that is both refreshing and intimidating

###### The word pragmatic comes from the Latin *pragmaticus* -"skilled in business"-meaning "fit for use." {style=color:LightSteelBlue}

#### What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer? {style=color:SkyBlue}
- **Early adopter / fast adapter**
  - When given something new, you can grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of yoour knowledge.

- **Inquisitive**
  - You tend to ask questions - *how did you do that? Did you have problems with that library? What's this quantum computing I've heard about? How are symbolic links implemented?*

- **Critical thinker**
  -You rarely take things as given without first getting the facts. "Because that's the way it's done", you smell a challenge.

- **Realistic**
  - You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face. This realism gives you a good feel for how difficult things are, and how long things will take.

- **Jack of all trades**
  - Although your current job may require you to be a specialist, you will always be able to move on to new areas and new challenges.

### 1. Care about your craft {style=color:LightPink}
### 2. Think! About your work {style=color:LightPink}

In order to be a Pragmatic Programmer, we're challenging you to think about what you're doing while you're doing it. This isn't a one-time audit of current practices-it's an ongoing critical appraisal of every decision you make, every day, and on every project. Never run on auto-pilot. Constantly be thinking, critiquing your work in real time. THINK!, is the Pragmatic Programmer's mantra.

The reward is a more active involvement with a job you love, a feeling mastery over an increasing range of subjects, and pleasure in a feeling of continuous improvement.

It was their belief in their indivudual contributions that sustaines the projects: *We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals*

*"Kaizen"* is a Japanese term that captures the concept of continuously making many small improvements.

Every day, work to refine the skills you have and to add new tolls to your repertoire.

## A pragmatic philosophy {style=color:IndianRed}
----

What distinguishes Pragmetic Programmers? We feel it's an attitude, a style, a philosophy of approaching problemas and their solutions. They think beyond the immediate problem, placing it in its larger context and seeking out the bigger picture.

Another key to their success is that Pragmatic Programmers take responsibility for everything they do.

### 3. You have agency {style=color:LightPink}

Does your work enviironment suck? Is your job boring? Try to fix it. But don't try forever. As Martin Fowler says, "you can change your organization or change your organization".

Pragmatic Programmers take charge of therir own career, and aren't afraid to admit ignorance or error.

Despite thorough testing, good documentation, and sold automation, things go wrong. Deliveries are late. Unforeseen technical problems come up.

###### Team trust {style=color:LightSteelBlue}

These things happen, and we try to deal with them as professionally as we can. This means being honest and direct.

In a healthy environment based in trust, you can safely speak your mind, present your ideas, and rely on your team members who can in turn rely on you.

###### Take Responsibility {style=color:LightSteelBlue}

When you make a mistake (as we all do) or an error in judgment, admit it honestly and try to offer options.

Don't blame someone or something else, or make up an excuse. Don't blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management, or your coworkers. Any and all of these may play a role, but it is up to you to provide solutions, not excuses.

### 4. Provide options, don't make lame excuses {style=color:LightPink}

Before you approach anyone to tell them why something can't be done, is late, or is broken, stop and listen to yourself. Talk to the rubber duck on your monitor, or the cat. Does your excuse sound reasonable, or stupid? How's it going to sound your boss?

Will they assk, "Have you tried this..." or "Didn't you consider that?" How will you respond? Before you go and tell them the bad news, is there anything else you can try? Sometimes, you just know what they are going to say, so save them the trouble.

Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done to salvage the situation.

Don't be afraid to ask, or to admit that you need help.

Try to flush out the lame excuses before voicing them aloud.

- When you find yourself saying, "I don't know," be sure to follow it up with "-but I'll find out." It's a great way to admit what you don't know, but then take responsibility like a pro.

#### Software entropy {style=color:SkyBlue}

Entropy  is a term from physics that referes to the amount of "disorder" in a system. Unfortunately, the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that the entropy in the universe tends toward a maximun. When disorder increases in software, we call it "software rot." "Technical debt," with the implied notion that they'll pay it back someday.

### 5. Don't live with broken windows {style=color:LightPink}

Don't leave "broken windows" (bad designs, wrong decisions, or poor code) unrepaired. If there is insufficient time to fix it properly, then board it up. Perhaps you can comment out the offending code, or display a "Not Implemented" message, or substitute dummy data instead. Take some action to prevent further damage and to show that you're on top of the situation.

But neglect accelerates the rot faster than any other factor.

You may be thinking that no one has the time to go around cleaning up all the broken glass of a project. If so, then you'd better plan on getting a dumpster, or moving to another neighborhood. Don't let entropy win.
