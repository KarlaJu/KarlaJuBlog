# The Pragmatic Programmer 
#### Extract from the book of david Thomas and Andrew Hunt

> Programming is about trying to make the future less painful. It's about making things easier for our teammates. It's about getting things wrong and being able to bounce back. It's about forming good habits. It's about understanding your toolset. Coding is just part of th worl of being a programmer.

>There is a unique dedication to learning and practicality that is both refreshing and intimidating

The word pragmatic comes from the Latin *pragmaticus* -"skilled in business"-meaning "fit for use."

### What Makes a Pragmatic Programmer?
- **Early adopter / fast adapter**
When given something new, you can grasp it quickly and integrate it with the rest of yoour knowledge.
- **Inquisitive**
You tend to ask questions - *how did you do that? Did you have problems with that library? What's this quantum computing I've heard about? How are symbolic links implemented?*
- **Critical thinker**
You rarely take things as given without first getting the facts. "Because that's the way it's done", you smell a challenge.
- **Realistic**
You try to understand the underlying nature of each problem you face. This realism gives you a good feel for how difficult things are, and how long things will take.
- **Jack of all trades**
Although your current job may require you to be a specialist, you will always be able to move on to new areas and new challenges.
